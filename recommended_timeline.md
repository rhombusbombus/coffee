## Recommended timeline:

Given the context and goals for The Friends' Street Corner Libraries (SCLs) and the specific requirements for a mobile app that works offline and can share data via QR code, we'll need to choose a development approach that allows for rapid prototyping and easy deployment. Considering the 6-hour timeframe for a rough version, a combination of a cross-platform framework for the app development and local storage for data persistence will be essential. Here's a suggested plan:

### 1. Select Frameworks and Tools

- **Front-end Design**: Use Figma for UI/UX design. Given the timeframe, create a simple and intuitive design focusing on the app's MVP features.
- **App Development Framework**: Choose Flutter or React Native for cross-platform mobile app development. Both frameworks allow for quick iteration and can compile to both iOS and Android.
- **Local Storage**: SQLite or Realm can be used for local data storage on the user's device. These databases are lightweight and support offline data persistence.
- **QR Code Generation and Scanning**: Use a library like QR Flutter (for Flutter) or react-native-qrcode-svg (for React Native) to generate and scan QR codes within the app.

### 2. MVP Features

- **Data Collection Form**: Design a simple form in Figma for collecting contact information, capturing images, and taking notes.
- **Local Data Storage**: Implement SQLite or Realm to store the collected data locally on the device.
- **QR Code Sharing**: Add functionality to generate QR codes that encode the data for easy sharing and include a QR code scanner for receiving shared data.

### 3. Development Process

#### Step 1: Figma Design (1 Hour)

- Quickly design the app's main screens: Home, Data Collection Form, and QR Code Display/Scanner.
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use.

#### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment (30 Minutes)

- Initialize a new project in Flutter or React Native.
- Install necessary libraries for local storage and QR code generation/scanning.

#### Step 3: Implement UI Based on Figma Design (2 Hours)

- Translate the Figma design into code, creating the basic UI components.
- Ensure the layout is responsive and accessible on different device sizes.

#### Step 4: Integrate Local Storage (1 Hour)

- Implement functionality to save and retrieve form data using SQLite or Realm.
- Test data persistence by adding, viewing, and deleting entries.

#### Step 5: QR Code Functionality (1 Hour)

- Add QR code generation for sharing data entries. Ensure the generated QR code encapsulates the necessary data in a compact format.
- Implement QR code scanning to receive and store shared data.

#### Step 6: Testing and Refinement (30 Minutes)

- Conduct basic testing on both Android and iOS devices to ensure functionality works as expected.
- Make quick adjustments based on testing results.

### 4. Presentation Preparation (1 Hour)

- Prepare a simple presentation that outlines the app's features, focusing on the MVP and its benefits for The Friends' SCLs.
- Include screenshots or a live demo of the app showcasing the data collection, local storage, and QR code sharing/scanning features.

### Conclusion

Given the tight timeframe, the focus should be on delivering a functional prototype that demonstrates the core idea. This plan prioritizes rapid development and leverages powerful, flexible tools to meet the project's requirements. Following the presentation, feedback should be gathered for future iterations, with a focus on refining the app based on real-world use and expanding its features.
