### Problem Statement:

An app to help the Friends keep track of community members met at local street-corner library events and general notes that volunteers want to record, to help adapt strategies and outreach to get a library back in our community.
    
### Background Information:
    
The Friends of Hoover Durant Public Library (“The Friends”) exists to bring a public library branch back to the Hoover Durant, McClymonds and Clawson neighborhoods in West Oakland, California. One key program area for The Friends are Street Corner Libraries (SCLs), which are when a volunteer team brings books and resources to distribute for free at local community events. Although we have a pen and paper system to keep track of key information we gather there, we are looking for ways to better collect and report our data from these events.
    
### Goals:
    ⭐ Can be used by both volunteers and the community members in just a few minutes.

    ⭐ Can hold different types of data (e.g. contact information, images, notes)

    ⭐ Can use this technology relying on only mobile networks and devices.
