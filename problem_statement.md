### Problem Statement:

A platform designed for a customer focused and controlled coffee subscription for 1951 that eases customer onboarding and customer retention.
    
### Background Information:
    
Currently, 1951 Coffee Company sells bags of coffee online through our Squarespace Portal.  We offer subscriptions, but they are rigid and do not give the customer any control over the subscription once it has started. Any adjustments that need to be made beyond pausing a subscription require canceling the subscription and starting a new one.  Right now we manage a very small number of subscriptions (8 customers), but want to grow this to over 100 customers. We cannot do that if 1951 Coffee staff have to manage the subscription in the background and any changes require cancelation.
    
### Goals:
    ⭐ Easily onboard customers to a 1951 Coffee Subscription that is built to their liking
    
    ⭐ Enable customers to manage their own subscriptions from coffee choice, frequency, and duration, to pausing and canceling.
    
    ⭐ All subscriptions to be purchased alongside one-time purchase items.
